Smart Contract Management with Next.js and Hardhat
This project demonstrates a basic smart contract management system using Next.js for the frontend and Hardhat for deploying and testing smart contracts.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js
npm
Hardhat
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Running the Project
To run the project, follow these steps:

Open three terminals in your VS Code or any terminal emulator of your choice.

In the first terminal, navigate to the project directory and install dependencies if you haven't already:

bash
Copy code
npm install
In the second terminal, start the Hardhat node:

bash
Copy code
npx hardhat node
In the third terminal, deploy the smart contracts to the local Hardhat network:

bash
Copy code
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
Go back to the first terminal and launch the front-end application:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to interact with the application.
